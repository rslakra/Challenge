## Data Structure & Algorithms

### The Software Process

When we consider computer programming, we immediately think of writing code in
some computer language. As a beginning student of computer science, you wrote programs
that solved relatively simple problems. Much of your effort went into learning
the syntax of a programming language such as ```Java``` or ```C++```: the language’s reserved
words, its data types, its constructs for selection and looping, and its input/output
mechanisms.

As your programs grow larger and more complex, you must pay attention to other
software issues in addition to coding. If you become a software professional, you may
work as part of a team that develops a system containing tens of thousands, or even
millions, of lines of code. The activities involved in such a software project’s whole
“life cycle” clearly go beyond just sitting down at a computer and writing programs.

**These activities include:**

- ```Problem analysis``` - Understanding the nature of the problem to be solved
- ```Requirements elicitation``` - Determining exactly what the program must do
- ```Software specification``` - Specifying what the program must do (the functional
  requirements) and the constraints on the solution approach (nonfunctional
  requirements, such as what language to use)
- ```High & low-level design``` Recording how the program meets the requirements,
  from the “big picture” overview to the detailed design
- Implementation of the design Coding a program in a computer language
- Testing and verification Detecting and fixing errors and demonstrating the
  correctness of the program
- Delivery Turning over the tested program to the customer or user (or instructor)
- Operation Actually using the program
- Maintenance Making changes to fix operational errors and to add or modify
  the function of the program

Software development is not simply a matter of going through these steps sequentially.
Many activities take place concurrently. We may be coding one part of the solution
while we’re designing another part, or defining requirements for a new version of a
program while we’re still testing the current version. Often a number of people work on
different parts of the same program simultaneously. Keeping track of all these activities
requires planning.

We use the term software engineering to refer to the discipline concerned with
all aspects of the development of high-quality software systems. It encompasses
all variations of techniques used during the software life cycle plus supporting
activities such as documentation and teamwork. A software process is a specific
set of inter-related software engineering techniques used by a person or
organization to create a system.

### Software engineering

The discipline devoted to the design, production, and maintenance of computer
programs that are developed on time and within cost estimates, using tools that
help to manage the size and complexity of the resulting software products

### Software process

A standard, integrated set of software engineering tools and techniques used on
a project or by an organization.

The Software Process

When we consider computer programming, we immediately think of writing code in
some computer language. As a beginning student of computer science, you wrote programs
that solved relatively simple problems. Much of your effort went into learning
the syntax of a programming language such as Java or C++: the languageâ€™s reserved
words, its data types, its constructs for selection and looping, and its input/output
mechanisms.

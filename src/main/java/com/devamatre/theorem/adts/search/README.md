## Floor - the floor function is the function that takes as input a real number x, and gives as output the greatest integer less than or equal to x, denoted ```⌈x⌉``` or ```floor(x)```. Similarly,

## Ceiling - the ceiling function maps x to the smallest integer greater than or equal to x, denoted ```⌈x⌉``` or ```ceil(x)```.

For example, for floor: ⌊2.4⌋ = 2, ⌊−2.4⌋ = −3, and for ceiling: ⌈2.4⌉ = 3, and ⌈−2.4⌉ = −2.

Historically, the floor of x has been–and still is–called the integral part or integer part of x, often denoted [x] (as well as a variety of other notations).
However, the same term, integer part, is also used for truncation towards zero, which differs from the floor function for negative numbers.

Although floor(x+1) and ceil(x) produce graphs that appear exactly alike, they are not the same when the value of x is an exact integer.

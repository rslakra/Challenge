## 1. Bubble Sort

Compare adjacent elements and swap the elements based on the sorting order

Time Complexity: O(N^2)

## 2. Selection Sort

Select either min or max element and put it at it's correct position. While iterating, exclude the currently sorted
position in the next iteration.

Time Complexity: O(N^2)

## 3. Insertion Sort

Pick the element at ith index and sort all the elements earlier than it by inserting the element at it's correct
position.

Time Complexity: O(N^2)

## 4. Cyclic Sort

It's used when the shuffled numbers are strictly contains N distinct numbers from 0 to N. While iterating, direct, swap
the numbers with it's correct index.

Time Complexity: O(N)

## 4. Merge Sort

Time Complexity: O(N log N)
